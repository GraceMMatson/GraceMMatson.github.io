                    HI! I'M GRACE MATSON. Or I'm Fowlren... if you follow me on Instagram. I'm a graphic designer, illustrator, bird enthusiast, music collector, and Zelda fanatic based in Bellingham Washington. When it comes to design, I enjoy branding, motion, and custom typography the most right now. I also do illustration; that's something else I've also enjoyed for a long time.

                    My image on this page is a linocut print I did a couple of years ago 
                    for my premajor portfolio. I feel like it represents me because I really love birds and wildlife. These were limited edition because the block is destroyed in the process of adding different colors In current days, I'm learning how to make stuff look cool at Western Washington University.

                        The Shining is a 1980 psychological horror film[7] produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick and co-written with novelist Diane Johnson. It is based on Stephen King's novel and stars Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd, and Scatman Crothers. The film presents the descent into insanity of a recovering alcoholic and aspiring novelist (Nicholson) who takes a job as winter caretaker for a haunted mountain resort hotel with his wife (Duvall) and clairvoyant son (Lloyd).P roduction took place almost exclusively in England at EMI Elstree Studios, with sets based on real locations.

                        Kubrick often worked with a small crew, which allowed him to do many takes, sometimes to the exhaustion of the actors and staff. The then-new Steadicam mount was used to shoot several scenes, giving the film an innovative and immersive look and feel. The film was released in the United States on May 23, 1980, by Warner Bros., and in the United Kingdom on October 2 by Columbia Pictures through Columbia-EMI-Warner Distributors. There were several versions for theatrical releases, each of which was cut shorter than the preceding cut; about 27 minutes was cut in total. Reactions to the film at the time of its release were mixed; King criticized the film due to its deviations from the novel. The film received two controversial nominations at the first Razzies in 1981—Worst Director and Worst Actress—the latter of which was later rescinded in 2022 due to Kubrick's alleged[8] treatment of Duvall on set.
