                                        <p>Keep in mind, a lot of this is speculation. Based on what’s said in Tears of the Kingdom, there are two main spots on the Zelda timeline where the game’s ancient past could fit. One is way back; sometime after Skyward Sword, but before The Minish Cap. The spot is actually way ahead of all the other games, but still before Breath of the Wild. And to figure out which is more likely, there’s one big detail we have to pay attention to: the founding of Hyrule.</p><p>In TOTK’s past, Rauru comes down from the sky and, together with Sonia, establishes the Kingdom of Hyrule. He’s  shown as the first king of this new kingdom, and that has some big implications. We’ve only seen Hyrule get founded a couple of times before in the series; once after Skyward Sword, and again after Phantom Hourglass in the Adult Timeline.</p><p>But, TOTK can’t be tied to the Phantom Hourglass timeline, because in that version, Link and Zelda (as Tetra) start a new Hyrule Kingdom, not Rauru. That leaves us with the earlier option. While Skyward Sword ends with the setup for a new kingdom, it never actually shows Hyrule being founded. So, it’s completely possible that the era we see in TOTK is filling in that gap.</p><p>That said, there’s also a theory that TOTK and BOTW are set much further in the future than some may think. If this is true, then the 10,000-year-old history Zelda travels back to might actually come after every other Zelda game. In that case, Rauru wouldn’t be founding Hyrule for the first time, he would instead be rebuilding it, long after the original kingdom had disappeared or been forgotten.</p><p>Whichever way you look at it, TOTK adds a whole new layer to the timeline, and really makes you question how many times Hyrule has risen, fallen, and been born again.</p>

Its in here that they find historical murals depicting the founding of Hyrule and a subsequent conflict known as the Imprisoning War—an ancient battle against the "Demon King", whom sought to rule Hyrule under his evil reign—which Zelda believes to be related to the mysterious Zonai race, an ancient people that she has been studying.</p><p>Upon venturing deeper in the cavern, Link and Zelda discover a mummy being restrained by a disembodied arm. In an instant, the mummy awakens and attacks the princess and her knight. In the aftermath of the scuffle, Link's right arm is wounded, and his Master Sword shattered. The sword remnants fall into a portal. Hyrule Castle is then raised into the sky, while Zelda falls into the depths below; as Link tries to catch her, she vanishes along with a mysterious glimmering artifact. Link is rescued by the disembodied arm, awakening later on the Great Sky Island to find that it replaced his previously damaged limb.</p>

                                            <p>The artifact Zelda encountered when she made her fall through the chasm was a secret stone that transported her to the distant past, where she meets Rauru, Hyrule's first king, and Sonia, its first queen. She quickly bonded with the royal couple, seeing them as  parental figures she never had in previous years. Here, while Zelda is in the past, Ganondorf tragically murders Sonia to take hold of her precious secret stone and uses its power to become the Demon King.</p><p>In response, Rauru appoints his older sister Mineru, Zelda, and the leaders of the Zora, Rito, Gorons, and Gerudo as powerful sages. With the help of everyone during an intense and devastating battle, Ganondorf was weakened but unfortunately, still on the prowl. To make sure that Ganondorf could no longer spread his hate, King Rauru sacrifices himself, using his power to encase the two into stone to seal the demon king away. However, it is said that this seal will not last forever. After this battle, princess Zelda, still in the past, receives the shattered Master Sword from the future and tasks the sages with aiding Link to defeat the Demon king, once he ineveitably reawakens.</p>

But, there is no possible way to assure that Link will safely recieve his precious sword if its left to rot somewhere in Hyrule until present day. Because of this, Zelda decides to makes the sacrifice of a lifetime; she swallows her secret stone and undergoes the process of "dragonification"; when a secret stone is swallowed by its user, they will transform into an immortal dragon. This process can never be reversed. Zelda immediately begins bursting with rays of light, tears streaming down her face, as she transforms into a beastly light dragon, flying through the air. She keeps the sword on the crest of her head, forever looping around Hyrule in the sky.</p><p>Back in the the present, after ridding the Great Deku Tree from gloom in Korok Forest, Link finally puts the pieces together; his princess sacrificed herself to protect his sword, and he must go retrive it. He finds her soraing in the sky, and gracefully removed the repaired sword encased in her head. Link then goesbelow Hyrule Castle to confront Ganondorf, in a place called the Depths.</p>

They also use their power to restore his right arm before fading away; he and Zelda fall to the surface in eachothers arms, where they finally reunite.</p><p> Some time later, on the Great Sky Island, The spirit of Mineru bids farewell to Zelda and Link before fading away, while the new sages vow to protect Hyrule going forward.</p>
