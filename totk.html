                                    <p>Based on statements in the game, the two most logical places on the Zelda Timeline that TOTK's past time period could take place are either after every other game but before BOTW, or in between Skyward Sword and The Minish Cap. There is one important piece of lore that is imperative to consider when talking about TOTK's past: the founding of Hyrule.</p> <p>When Rauru arrives from the sky and creates his kingdom in TOTK's past, he founds the Kingdom of Hyrule alongside Sonia. Rauru being the first king of Hyrule has interesting consequences in regard to the timeline. The only other times Hyrule was founded in the timeline was after Skyward Sword, before the timeline split, and after Phantom Hourglass, on the Adult Timeline.</p><p>Rauru in TOTK founding Hyrule after Phantom Hourglass isn't possible because it’s Link and Zelda who founded that new version of the Kingdom in the Adult Timeline. However, because the actual founding of a kingdom named Hyrule was never shown in Skyward Sword, but rather occurred slightly later on the timeline, it’s at least possible that TOTK's past could take place there.</p><p>On the other hand, there's the possibility BOTW and TOTK take place much further into the future from every other Zelda game than fans realize. If that's the case, then the 10,000 years of time that Princess Zelda travels back to in TOTK could theoretically still occur after every other game. This would mean that Rauru's "founding" of Hyrule is actually a refounding of a new Hyrule after the one from prior games was somehow lost to time.</p>

Here , they find historical murals depicting the founding of Hyrule and a subsequent conflict known as the Imprisoning War—an ancient battle against the "Demon King", whom sought to rule Hyrule under his evil reign—which Zelda believes to be related to the mysterious Zonai race.</p><p>Upon venturing deeper, Link and Zelda discover a mummy being restrained by a disembodied arm. The mummy awakens and attacks the princess and her knight. In the aftermath of the scuffle, Link's right arm is wounded, and the Master Sword is shattered by the power of the mummy and disappears into a portal.Hyrule Castle is then raised into the sky, while Zelda falls into the depths below; as Link tries to catch her, she vanishes along with a mysterious glimmering artifact. Link is rescued by the arm, awakening later on the Great Sky Island to find that it has replaced his previously damaged limb.</p>

After defeating the various monsters that have taken over the temples, the group finds artifacts called secret stones and meet the spirits of ancient sages, who appoint Link's allies as their successors and pass down their secret stones and special abilities.</p>

However, it is said that this seal will not last forever. After this battle, princess Zelda, still in the past, receives the shattered Master Sword from the future and tasks the sages with aiding Link once Ganondorf reawakened, which they followed as previously discussed.</p>
